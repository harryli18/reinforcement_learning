# Reinforcement Learning

Q-learning is one of the early breakthroughs in reinforcement learning developed by Chris Watkins
in 1989 when he was a graduate student at Cambridge University. The algorithm is efficient and
simple. It is still one of the most popular algorithms today. This report shows the implementation
of Q-learning in a navigation task. The impact of different parameters (e.g. learning rate, discount
rate, exploration factor, decay) are studied. A grid search is performed to find the optimal
combination. Furthermore, Double Q-learning, invented to solve overestimation from Q-learning,
is implemented to understand the differences to Q-learning. In addition, the parallelism between
Q-learning and psychological learning theories is discussed.
